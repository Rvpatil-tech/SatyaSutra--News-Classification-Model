📰 Satyasutra  - News Article Classification (Fake or Real) 

🔍 Objective  
Satyasutra is a powerful NLP-based model designed to classify news articles as either fake or real with high accuracy.  

🛠 Tools Used  
Python 🐍  
Sklearn ⚙️  
Pandas 📊  
NLTK 📖  

📌 Steps to Follow  
1️⃣ Collect a labeled dataset from Kaggle containing both fake and real news articles  
2️⃣ Preprocess the text data using NLTK to clean and standardize it  
3️⃣ Convert text into numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization  
4️⃣ Train the Satyasutra model using Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes  
5️⃣ Evaluate model performance with metrics like F1-score and accuracy  
6️⃣ Build a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for input and prediction  

🎯 How It Works  
Users can input a news article into the Streamlit interface, and the trained Satyasutra model will analyze the text and classify it as either fake or real based on learned patterns.  

📈 Expected Results  
The Satyasutra model aims to provide a highly accurate classification by learning and adapting to complex linguistic cues within news articles.
